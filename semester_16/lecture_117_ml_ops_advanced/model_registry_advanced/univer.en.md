## Key Implementation Details

```python

    """Advanced model registry."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.registry: Dict[str, dict] = {}
        self.lineage: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}

    def register_model(
        self, model_id: str, model: any, parent_models: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        """Register model with lineage."""
        self.registry[model_id] = {"model": model, "created_at": 0}
        if parent_models:
            self.lineage[model_id] = parent_models

    def get_lineage(self, model_id: str) -> List[str]:
        """Get model lineage."""
        return self.lineage.get(model_id, [])

    def search_models(self, query: dict) -> List[str]:
        """Search models."""
        results = []
        for model_id, model_info in self.registry.items():
            if all(model_info.get(k) == v for k, v in query.items()):
                results.append(model_id)
        return results
```


## Common Application Errors

- **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** Solution: Test with empty input, single element, and boundary values.
- **Misunderstanding complexity implications:** Solution: Analyze time and space complexity for your use case.
- **Suboptimal implementation:** Solution: Profile and optimize based on actual usage patterns.
- **Incorrect assumptions about input:** Solution: Validate input format and constraints before processing.

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

**Try this example:**
```
Input: [example data]

Step 1: Initialize algorithm state
Step 2: Process input data
Step 3: Generate result

Output: [algorithm result]
```



## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
