## Key Implementation Details

```python
class HuffmanNode:
    """Huffman tree node."""

    def __init__(self, char=None, freq=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.char = char
        self.freq = freq
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.freq < other.freq


def build_huffman_tree(text: str) -> HuffmanNode:
    """Build Huffman tree."""
    from collections import Counter
    from heapq import heappush, heappop

    freq = Counter(text)
    heap = []

    for char, count in freq.items():
        heappush(heap, HuffmanNode(char=char, freq=count))

    while len(heap) > 1:
        left = heappop(heap)
        right = heappop(heap)
        merged = HuffmanNode(freq=left.freq + right.freq, left=left, right=right)
        heappush(heap, merged)

    return heap[0] if heap else None


def build_huffman_codes(root: HuffmanNode, code: str = "", codes: dict = None) -> dict:
    """Build Huffman codes."""
    if codes is None:
        codes = {}

    if root.char is not None:
        codes[root.char] = code
    else:
        if root.left:
            build_huffman_codes(root.left, code + "0", codes)
        if root.right:
            build_huffman_codes(root.right, code + "1", codes)

    return codes
```


## Common Application Errors

- **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** Solution: Test with empty input, single element, and boundary values.
- **Misunderstanding complexity implications:** Solution: Analyze time and space complexity for your use case.
- **Suboptimal implementation:** Solution: Profile and optimize based on actual usage patterns.
- **Incorrect assumptions about input:** Solution: Validate input format and constraints before processing.

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

**Try this example:**
```
Input: [example data]

Step 1: Initialize algorithm state
Step 2: Process input data
Step 3: Generate result

Output: [algorithm result]
```



## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
