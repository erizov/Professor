# Fractional Knapsack

# School

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Fractional Knapsack: For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Category:** Greedy Algorithm
- **Key Idea:** For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

Fractional Knapsack: For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

**KNAPSACK** = Keep Noting All Possible Solutions, Always Check Knapsack. For each item, decide: take it or leave it?








This algorithm works by processing data systematically to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Greedy Algorithm** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

- Fractional Knapsack is used in [specific domain]
- Applied in [specific technology/framework]
- Used for [specific use case]

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Fractional Knapsack like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def fractional_knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    """Implementation."""
    items = [(values[i] / weights[i], weights[i], values[i]) for i in range(len(weights))]
    total_value = 0.0
    remaining = capacity
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

### 💡 How to Avoid
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify your logic
- Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
