# Insertion Sort

## Simple Explanation

Insertion Sort Step-by-Step Execution: Start([Start]) --> Init[Initialize array]

This algorithm works by processing data systematically to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Sorting** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n²)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

Insertion Sort is commonly used in:
- Sorting arrays in programming languages (Python sorted(), Java Collections.sort())
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Operating system process scheduling
- Computer science education and algorithm learning

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Insertion Sort like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    """Implementation."""
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    key = arr[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
        j -= 1
    arr[j + 1] = key
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

- Not handling edge cases (empty input, single element)
- Misunderstanding the complexity implications
- Incorrect implementation leading to wrong results
- Not optimizing for the specific use case
