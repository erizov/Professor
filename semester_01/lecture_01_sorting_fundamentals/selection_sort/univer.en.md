# Selection Sort

## Algorithm Overview

Selection Sort Step-by-Step Execution: Start([Start]) --> Init[Initialize array]

This algorithm belongs to the **Sorting** category and employs swapping elements to achieve its objectives.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- The algorithm's performance scales according to this complexity class
- Best, average, and worst cases may vary based on input characteristics

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
- Indicates the amount of additional memory required during execution

**Key Data Structures:** Standard data structures

## Real-World Applications

Selection Sort is used in:
- Sorting arrays in programming languages (Python sorted(), Java Collections.sort())
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Operating system process scheduling
- E-commerce product listings and price sorting

## Conceptual Similarities

This algorithm shares conceptual similarities with other algorithms in the Sorting category, following similar design patterns and optimization strategies.

## Related Algorithms

Selection Sort is often used in combination with:
- Complementary algorithms for preprocessing or post-processing
- Data structures that optimize its performance
- Other algorithms in the same complexity class

## Key Implementation Details

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    """Implementation."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
    min_idx = i
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
            min_idx = j
    arr[i], arr[min_idx] = (arr[min_idx], arr[i])
    return result
```

## Common Application Errors

- Incorrect handling of edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary conditions)
- Misunderstanding of complexity implications in large-scale systems
- Suboptimal implementation leading to performance degradation
- Incorrect assumptions about input data characteristics
- Not considering alternative algorithms for specific use cases
