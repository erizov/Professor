# Bubble Sort

- **Purpose:** Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares and rearranges elements until the list is sorted, like organizing items in order.
- **Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Category:** Sorting
- **Key Idea:** The largest element 'bubbles up' to the end in each pass, so we can reduce the comparison range each time.

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares and rearranges elements until the list is sorted, like organizing items in order.

The largest element 'bubbles up' to the end in each pass, so we can reduce the comparison range each time.

**BUBBLE** = Bring Up Bigger, Leave Elements. Think of bubbles rising in water - larger elements float to the top!

This algorithm works by swapping elements, comparing elements to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Sorting** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n²)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

Bubble Sort is commonly used in:
- Sorting arrays in programming languages (Python sorted(), Java Collections.sort())
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Operating system process scheduling
- Computer science education and algorithm learning

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Bubble Sort like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def bubble_sort(data):
    """Implementation of Bubble Sort."""
    # Core algorithm logic
    return result
```

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

**Try sorting this by hand:**
```
Input: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

Pass 1:
  Compare 5 and 2 → 5 > 2, swap → [2, 5, 8, 1, 9]
  Compare 5 and 8 → 5 < 8, no swap → [2, 5, 8, 1, 9]
  Compare 8 and 1 → 8 > 1, swap → [2, 5, 1, 8, 9]
  Compare 8 and 9 → 8 < 9, no swap → [2, 5, 1, 8, 9]
  Largest element (9) is now at the end!

Pass 2:
  Compare 2 and 5 → 2 < 5, no swap → [2, 5, 1, 8, 9]
  Compare 5 and 1 → 5 > 1, swap → [2, 1, 5, 8, 9]
  (No need to check 8 and 9 - already sorted)

Continue until sorted: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
```

## ✏️ Practice Exercise

**Exercise 1 (Easy):**
Sort this list by hand: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Show each pass and count how many swaps you make.

**Exercise 2 (Medium):**
Write a function to sort a list of student names alphabetically using bubble sort.

**Exercise 3 (Hard):**
Optimize bubble sort to stop early if the list is already sorted. How does this improve performance?

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

**Q1:** How many passes are needed for n elements in the worst case?
**A:** At most n-1 passes (the last element is already in place after n-1 passes).

**Q2:** What is the best-case time complexity and when does it occur?
**A:** O(n) when the array is already sorted and we use early termination.

**Q3:** Why is bubble sort called "bubble" sort?
**A:** Because larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the array, like bubbles rising in water.

**Q4:** Is bubble sort stable?
**A:** Yes, it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
