# Quick Sort

## Algorithm Overview

Quick Sort Step-by-Step Execution: Start([Start]) --> Init[Initialize array]

This algorithm belongs to the **Sorting** category and employs systematic data processing to achieve its objectives.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- The algorithm's performance scales according to this complexity class
- Best, average, and worst cases may vary based on input characteristics

**Space Complexity:** O(log n)
- Indicates the amount of additional memory required during execution

**Key Data Structures:** stack

## Real-World Applications

Quick Sort is used in:
- Sorting arrays in programming languages (Python sorted(), Java Collections.sort())
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Operating system process scheduling
- E-commerce product listings and price sorting

## Conceptual Similarities

This algorithm shares conceptual similarities with other algorithms in the Sorting category, following similar design patterns and optimization strategies.

## Related Algorithms

Quick Sort is often used in combination with:
- Complementary algorithms for preprocessing or post-processing
- Data structures that optimize its performance
- Other algorithms in the same complexity class

## Key Implementation Details

```python
def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
    """Implementation."""
    if high is None:
    high = len(arr) - 1
    if low < high:
    pivot_idx = partition(arr, low, high)
    quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_idx - 1)
    quick_sort(arr, pivot_idx + 1, high)
    return result
```

## Common Application Errors

- Incorrect handling of edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary conditions)
- Misunderstanding of complexity implications in large-scale systems
- Suboptimal implementation leading to performance degradation
- Incorrect assumptions about input data characteristics
- Not considering alternative algorithms for specific use cases
