# Merge Sort

# School

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Merge Sort: Repeatedly compares and rearranges elements until the list is sorted, like organizing items in order.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Category:** Sorting
- **Key Idea:** Divide the array in half, sort each half, then merge the sorted halves together.

Merge Sort: Repeatedly compares and rearranges elements until the list is sorted, like organizing items in order.

Divide the array in half, sort each half, then merge the sorted halves together.

**MERGE** = Make Equal, Recursively Group Elements. Like merging two sorted piles of papers into one.








This algorithm works by comparing elements to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Sorting** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(n)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

Merge Sort is commonly used in:
- Sorting arrays in programming languages (Python sorted(), Java Collections.sort())
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Operating system process scheduling
- Computer science education and algorithm learning

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Merge Sort like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """Implementation."""
    if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
**Solution:** Check base case: `if len(data) <= 1: return data`

### ❌ Mistake 2: Trace through examples step-by-step
**Solution:** Manually trace through a small example (3-5 elements) to verify each step matches the algorithm logic

### ❌ Mistake 3: Use debugging tools to verify your logic
**Solution:** Use print statements or debugger to check variable values at each step, compare with expected behavior

### ❌ Mistake 4: Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
**Solution:** Study the algorithm's pseudocode or description, identify the core steps, then implement one step at a time

### 💡 How to Avoid
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify your logic
- Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
