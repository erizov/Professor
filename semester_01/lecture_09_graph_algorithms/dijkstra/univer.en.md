## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)
- The algorithm's performance scales according to this complexity class
- Best, average, and worst cases may vary based on input characteristics

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
- Indicates the amount of additional memory required during execution

**Key Data Structures:** heap/priority queue, hash table/dictionary

## Real-World Applications

Dijkstra is used in:
- GPS navigation systems (Google Maps, Waze)
- Network routing protocols (OSPF, IS-IS)
- Social media friend recommendations
- Game pathfinding (A* algorithm)

## Conceptual Similarities

This algorithm shares conceptual similarities with other algorithms in the Graph Algorithms category, following similar design patterns and optimization strategies.

## Related Algorithms

Dijkstra is often used in combination with:
- Complementary algorithms for preprocessing or post-processing
- Data structures that optimize its performance
- Other algorithms in the same complexity class

## Key Implementation Details

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    """Implementation."""
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.
