# Dijkstra

# School

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Dijkstra: Greedy approach: always process the closest unvisited node first, ensuring shortest paths are found.
- **Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Category:** Algorithms
- **Key Idea:** Greedy approach: always process the closest unvisited node first, ensuring shortest paths are found.

Dijkstra: Greedy approach: always process the closest unvisited node first, ensuring shortest paths are found.

Greedy approach: always process the closest unvisited node first, ensuring shortest paths are found.

**DIJKSTRA** = Distance Increases, Just Keep Shortest Track Record Always. Always pick the closest unvisited node first.








This algorithm works by processing data systematically to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Graph Algorithms** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n²)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

- GPS navigation systems (finding shortest routes)
- Network routing protocols
- Social network analysis (shortest path between users)
- Game development (pathfinding in games)

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Dijkstra like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    """Implementation."""
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    return result
```

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

**Try this example:**
```
Input: [example data]

Step 1: Initialize algorithm state
Step 2: Process input data
Step 3: Generate result

Output: [algorithm result]
```



## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

### 💡 How to Avoid
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify your logic
- Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
