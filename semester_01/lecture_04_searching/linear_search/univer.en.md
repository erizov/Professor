## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.
