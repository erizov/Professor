# Binary Search Tree

# Univer

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Binary Search Tree finds a specific element or pattern in a data structure.
- **Complexity:** Varies time, Varies space
- **Category:** Data Structure
- **Key Idea:** Uses divide-and-conquer or linear search strategy to locate target efficiently.

Step 2: Check middle of right half (index 4, value 9)

The algorithm works by applying systematic transformations to input data based on Data Structure principles.

**BINARY_SEARCH_TREE** = Remember: Understand the problem → Apply Data Structure principles → Process systematically → Verify results


## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n) to O(n²) depending on implementation
- Analysis based on algorithm structure and data operations
- Best, average, and worst cases depend on input characteristics
- Consider input size and data distribution

**Space Complexity:** O(1) to O(n) depending on approach
- Additional memory for data structures and recursion
- Auxiliary space for temporary variables
- Consider in-place vs. extra space implementations

**Key Data Structures:** 
- Based on algorithm type: arrays, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.


## Real-World Applications

Binary Search Tree is used in:
- **Database Systems:** Index lookups, query optimization
- **Information Retrieval:** Finding documents, text search
- **Networking:** Routing tables, DNS lookups
- **Compilers:** Symbol table lookups, code optimization


## Conceptual Similarities

Binary Search Tree is conceptually similar to:
- **Other search algorithms:** Linear Search, Hash-based search (different search strategies)
- **Tree traversal:** In-order, pre-order traversal (systematic exploration)
- **Binary operations:** Binary search trees use similar divide-and-conquer approach


## Related Algorithms

Binary Search Tree is often used in combination with:
- **Sorting algorithms:** Binary Search requires sorted data
- **Other search algorithms:** Linear Search, Hash-based search
- **Data structures:** Trees, Hash tables for efficient searching


## Key Implementation Details

```python
class BSTNode:
    """Binary Search Tree node."""

    def __init__(self, val: int):
        self.val = val
        self.left: Optional["BSTNode"] = None
        self.right: Optional["BSTNode"] = None
```


## Common Application Errors

- **Assuming input is sorted when it's not:** Solution: Verify input is sorted or use appropriate search algorithm.
- **Incorrect boundary conditions:** Solution: Use inclusive/exclusive bounds consistently.
- **Not handling duplicate values:** Solution: Decide whether to return first, last, or any occurrence.
- **Integer overflow in mid calculation:** Solution: Use `left + (right - left) // 2` instead of `(left + right) // 2`.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

```python
# Input
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
target = 7
left = 0
right = 6

# Iteration 1
mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3
arr[mid] = arr[3] = 7
7 == 7? Yes! Found at index 3

# Result
return 3
```

**Variable States:**
```
Iteration | left | right | mid | arr[mid] | Comparison | Action
----------|------|-------|-----|----------|------------|--------
    1     |  0   |   6   |  3  |    7     | 7 == 7     | Found!
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.
