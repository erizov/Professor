# Longest Common Subsequence

# School

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Longest Common Subsequence processes data according to Algorithms principles to achieve specific computational goals.
- **Complexity:** Varies time, Varies space
- **Category:** Algorithms
- **Key Idea:** Uses systematic approach to transform input data into desired output format.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Step-by-Step Execution:

The algorithm works by applying systematic transformations to input data based on Algorithms principles.

**LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE** = Remember: Understand the problem → Apply Algorithms principles → Process systematically → Verify results


## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n²)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

- General algorithmic problem solving

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Longest Common Subsequence like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(s1, s2):
    """Implementation."""
    m, n = (len(s1), len(s2))
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

### 💡 How to Avoid
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify your logic
- Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
