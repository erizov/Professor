# Knapsack

# School

## 📋 Quick Summary

- **Purpose:** Knapsack: For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.
- **Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Category:** Algorithms
- **Key Idea:** For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

Knapsack: For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

For each item, decide whether to include it or not - store the best value for each weight capacity.

**KNAPSACK** = Keep Noting All Possible Solutions, Always Check Knapsack. For each item, decide: take it or leave it?








This algorithm works by processing data systematically to achieve its goal. It's part of the **Dynamic Programming** category of algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n²)**, which means the time it takes to run depends on the size of the input data. The space complexity is **O(1)**, indicating how much extra memory is needed.

## Where It's Used in Practice

Knapsack is commonly used in:
- Resource allocation problems
- Portfolio optimization
- Cutting stock problems
- Computer science education and algorithm learning

## What It Can Be Compared To

Think of Knapsack like a systematic way of organizing or finding information - similar to how you might organize items or search through a collection efficiently.

## Minimal Code Example

```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    """Implementation."""
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
        if weights[i - 1] <= w:
            dp[i][w] = max(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])
        else:
            dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    return result
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
**Solution:** Add validation: `if not data or len(data) <= 1: return data`

### ❌ Mistake 2: Trace through examples step-by-step
**Solution:** Manually trace through a small example (3-5 elements) to verify each step matches the algorithm logic

### ❌ Mistake 3: Use debugging tools to verify your logic
**Solution:** Use print statements or debugger to check variable values at each step, compare with expected behavior

### ❌ Mistake 4: Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
**Solution:** Study the algorithm's pseudocode or description, identify the core steps, then implement one step at a time

### 💡 How to Avoid
- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify your logic
- Review the algorithm's key steps before implementing
