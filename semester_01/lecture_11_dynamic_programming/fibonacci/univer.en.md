**Try computing Fibonacci(5) by hand:**
```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution

**Step-by-Step Execution (Dynamic Programming):**

```python
# Input
n = 5
memo = {}

# Step 1: Base cases
memo[0] = 0
memo[1] = 1

# Step 2: Build up
memo[2] = memo[1] + memo[0] = 1 + 0 = 1
memo[3] = memo[2] + memo[1] = 1 + 1 = 2
memo[4] = memo[3] + memo[2] = 2 + 1 = 3
memo[5] = memo[4] + memo[3] = 3 + 2 = 5

# Result
return memo[5] = 5
```

**Variable States:**
```
Step | memo[0] | memo[1] | memo[2] | memo[3] | memo[4] | memo[5]
-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------
Init |    0    |    1    |    -    |    -    |    -    |    -
  1  |    0    |    1    |    1    |    -    |    -    |    -
  2  |    0    |    1    |    1    |    2    |    -    |    -
  3  |    0    |    1    |    1    |    2    |    3    |    -
  4  |    0    |    1    |    1    |    2    |    3    |    5
```

**Expected Output:**

```

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5

## ✅ Check Your Understanding

**Q1:** What are the base cases for Fibonacci?
**A:** F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

**Q2:** Why is recursive Fibonacci slow?
**A:** It recalculates the same values many times (exponential time complexity).

**Q3:** How does dynamic programming make Fibonacci faster?
**A:** By storing previously computed values, we avoid redundant calculations (linear time complexity).

**Q4:** What is the space complexity of DP Fibonacci?
**A:** O(n) if we store all values, or O(1) if we only keep the last two values.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.

- Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, boundary values)
- Trace through examples step-by-step
- Use debugging tools to verify variable values
- Review algorithm's key steps before implementing
