    def __init__(self, nodes: List[str]):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.consensus_value: Optional[any] = None

    def propose(self, value: any) -> bool:
        """Propose value."""
        pass

## Common Application Errors

- **Incorrect handling of edge cases:** Solution: Test with empty input, single element, and boundary values.
- **Misunderstanding complexity implications:** Solution: Analyze time and space complexity for your use case.
- **Suboptimal implementation:** Solution: Profile and optimize based on actual usage patterns.
- **Incorrect assumptions about input:** Solution: Validate input format and constraints before processing.

## 🎯 Try It Yourself

**Try this example:**
```
Input: [example data]

Step 1: Initialize algorithm state
Step 2: Process input data
Step 3: Generate result

Output: [algorithm result]
```



## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not handling edge cases
**Solution:** Always check for empty input, single element, or boundary values before processing.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect initialization
**Solution:** Ensure all variables and data structures are properly initialized before the main algorithm loop.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Off-by-one errors in loops
**Solution:** Carefully verify loop bounds and termination conditions. Test with small examples to catch boundary issues.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not validating input
**Solution:** Add input validation to ensure data is in expected format and within valid ranges.
